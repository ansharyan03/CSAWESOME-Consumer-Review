This game is definitely a *masterpiece. I own all the games in the Arkham series on console except Arkham Knight, and none of them have kept me playing till today like Arkham City has. Asylum and Origins are *great games on their own, but they don't have nearly as expansive a world as Arkham City has. This game has *too many side quests to count, a really interesting story with a ton of twists and turns, even more gadgets and upgrades, and *amazing combat and gameplay overall. I would give this game a rating of over 9,000 if I could.
